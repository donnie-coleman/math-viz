* [Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues, Explained Visually](http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/)  
  "Eigen means own, self... An eigenvector of an operator is one that acting on it with the operator brings it to itself, possibly scaled by a factor appropriately named eigenvalue." - [pa7x1](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/51cuyt/eigenvectors_and_eigenvalues_explained_visually/d7b99hb)

* [Grover’s Quantum Search Algorithm](http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post2644_grovers-quantum-search-algorithm)  
  "Grover’s algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that runs quadratically faster than any equivalent classical algorithm. With a budget of a million operations, a classical algorithm is limited to searching through about a million (unsorted, unstructured) possibilities. Grover’s algorithm, on the other hand, can use those million operations to search through hundreds of billions of possibilities"
